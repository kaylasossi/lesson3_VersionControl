        <!-- First Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic1">

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The first topic I found interesting was what this lesson is about and that is version control. Version control is a repository that documents all the changes to a file or set of files over time, so later on you can recall a specific version.  To keep track of these changes, most use a version control system. A VCS can track who changed a file, what time the file was changed, and more. One of the best benefits is if you mess up or lose a file, it can easily be recovered. Other benefits include multiple people working on a file at the same time without conflicts, files can’t be overwritten, and you can revert back to an older file version if needed. I find this topic interesting because I’ve had issues in the past when I was working on a project and needed an older version and wasn’t able to access it. Using VCS will help that situation drastically. It’s relevant to this course because it will help us tremendously when working on new files.

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Highlight #2
                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The second topic I found interesting is Git. Git is a type of version control system that is free. What makes Git different from other version control systems has to do with the way Git thinks about data. Git thinks of data as a series of snapshots. Basically every time you save your project, Git will take a snapshot of the state your project is in at that moment and store it. If the file has not changed, Git will save a link to the previous identical file. This is more efficient because two snapshots of the same file won’t be saved. I find this topic interesting because Git is essentially taking a picture of your work rather than other VCS which are just a list of your files. It’s relevant to this course because it’s a great tool to use when website designing.

                <span class="text-muted">Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The third topic I found interesting are repositories. There are two types of repositories. The first is a remote repository. A remote repository is on a remote server that multiple team members share. The second is a local repository. A local repository is on the local machine of an individual user. In order to create this type of repository, you can either make a brand new one or clone an existing remote repository on to your local machine. I find this topic interesting because I didn't realize there were two different types of repositories. It's relevant to this course because when designed a website, you can have options of which type of repository you think would fit best with your project. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">GitHub</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The fourth topic I found interesting was GitHub. This program is related to my second topic, Git. GitHub is the largest host for Git repositories. GitHub is responsible for a big percentage of all Git repositories. It is also used for issue tracking, Git hosting, and code reviewing. GitHub is a main point of collaboration for millions of developers. While using Git professionally, there's a big chance you will be interacting with GitHub at some point in your career. I find this topic interesting because I feel like I will be using it quite often in the future, so it's something I want to become more familiar with. It's relevant to this course because we will be using it interchangeably with Cloud9, so it's important we know how to work it. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Changes to Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The final topic I found interesting was making changes to repositories. Now that we know what repositories are and the different types, we must learn about changing them. The files in your working directory can be in either the tracked or untracked state. Tracked files are basically the files Git knows about. This includes unmodified, modified, or staged from your last snapshot. Untracked files are any files that weren't in your last snapshot or staging area from your working directory. As files are edited in Git, you must commit all the staged files that were modified to record changes. I find this topic interesting because I think it's important to know how to properly make changes to repositories. It's relevant to this course because we'll most likely be making many changes and modifications to repositories we're working on. </p>
